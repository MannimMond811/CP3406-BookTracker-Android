## Problem Statement
Many students struggle with time management, leading to missed deadlines, academic stress, and burnout. Based on Scenario 6, Lisa is a college student trying to balance classes, a part-time job, and social life. She gets overwhelmed by tasks and deadlines, often missing assignments or not knowing what to prioritize. Studies show poor time management can reduce productivity by 20-30% and cause anxiety.
